# Welcome to WebDAW

![WebDAW Logo](./images/logo-192.png)

__WebDAW__ is a portable music composition and production environment that runs in your browser. It is based on the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and the [Web MIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API) to provide a performant and feature rich foundation for music creation. Our intention is to use [Web Audio Modules 2.0](https://doi.org/10.1145/3487553.3524225) as plugin architecture to enable easy integration of synthesizers, effects and other relevant components.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

WebDAW requires a modern browser supporting Web Audio and Web MIDI. Recent browsers built using the 
[Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) browser engine, such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) 
or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) are stable environments meeting those requirements.

### Launching WebDAW

WebDAW can be launched by opening [https://ai-music.github.io/webdaw/](https://ai-music.github.io/webdaw/).
